# How to disable HSTS upgrade?

 Modern browsers **auto-upgrade HTTP to HTTPS** when possible ‚Äî often called **HTTPS-Only Mode** or **HSTS upgrade**. The behavior depends on the browser. Here‚Äôs how you can **disable auto-upgrade** so the browser actually uses plain `http://` when you type it.

## **Chrome / Edge (Chromium-based)**

1. Open `chrome://settings/security` (or `edge://settings/security`).
2. Scroll to **‚ÄúAlways use secure connections‚Äù**.
3. **Turn it off** (disable).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Chrome also uses **HSTS preload lists** for some sites (e.g., google.com, facebook.com). For those, you *cannot* force HTTP ‚Äî the browser will always use HTTPS.

## **Firefox**

1. Open `about:preferences#privacy`.
2. Scroll to **HTTPS-Only Mode**.
3. Select **Don‚Äôt enable HTTPS-Only Mode**.

Optional (advanced): In `about:config`, set

* `dom.security.https_only_mode` ‚Üí `false`
* `dom.security.https_only_mode_pbm` ‚Üí `false` (for private browsing).

## **Safari (macOS / iOS)**

Safari doesn‚Äôt have a simple toggle. It automatically upgrades to HTTPS if:

* The site is on the **HSTS preload list**, or
* The server previously sent an **HSTS header**.

üëâ You can‚Äôt fully disable this in Safari without using developer tools or a custom proxy that strips HSTS headers.
